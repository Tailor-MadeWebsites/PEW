<h1>Aims of processing data:</h1>
<p>To provide services under contract to you; provide services to others (in so far as this does not breach client confidentiality); comply with regulatory and other legal obligations; and protect P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors against potential claims.</p>


<h1>Who is responsible for your data?:</h1>
<p>P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors is responsible for your personal data. For the purposes of applicable data protection law (in particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the “GDPR”)), your data will be controlled by P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors Limited trading as P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors.</p>



<h1>Legal Basis </h1>
<p>Your data will be processed on the basis that P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors has a legitimate interest in being able to achieve the aims of processing set out above. Where special category data is provided, the provider of the data warrants that they consent to P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors processing that data or that they have obtained written consent from the data subject.</p>


<h1>Personal Data Held</h1>
<p>As a minimum, P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors is required to positively identify its clients. This also includes positively identifying a director in the case of a corporate client. In addition, P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors holds whatever information is provided to it by its clients and others. In most cases, this will not include special category data.</p>



<h1>Failure to Provide Data: </h1>
<p>If you fail to provide P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors with the data they require, you will not receive services.</p>


<h1>Data Sources: </h1>
<p>P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors obtains most personal data from its clients and those who have indicated that they have interest in P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors’ services. P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors also obtains some personal data from other correspondents and also from publicly available sources.</p>

<h1>Complaints Procedure</h1>
<p>If you are dissatisfied with the service we have provided then you have the right to complain.</p>

<p>We aim to offer all our clients an efficient and effective service. However should there be any aspect of our service with which you are unhappy with and which you cannot resolve with the fee earner then you may refer the matter to Mr. Phil Wilson and thereafter to The Legal Ombudsman service:</p>

<p>The Legal Ombudsman service has been operational since October 6th, 2010 and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that complaints are dealt with appropriately. However, before you contact the Legal Ombudsman you must first register an official complaint with us. Normally, the Legal Ombudsman expects you to give us 8 weeks to try to resolve the matter. If after 8 weeks you are still dissatisfied you can then involve the Legal Ombudsman. For more information on how the Legal Ombudsman works please  visit the Legal Ombudsman website.</p>


<h1>Timescales</h1>

<p>In normal circumstances you are required to register a complaint within one year.  You must then give us 8 weeks to try to resolve your complaint before contacting the Legal Ombudsman. A complaint to the Legal Ombudsman must normally be made within six months of the date of the conclusion of the Firm’s complaints procedure. In summary:</p>

<p>• You must register your complaint with us within one year.</p>
<p>• The Legal Ombudsman expects you to give us 8 weeks to try to resolve your complaint.</p>
<p>• After this time, you can contact the Legal Ombudsman (but you must do so within 6 months)</p>
