      <p>Landlords have a duty to carry out repairs within a reasonable period from the tenant having reported the disrepair in their rented accommodation.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
      
      <h3>Property Registration / Property Title Problems</h3>
      <p>All land and property ownership in England and Wales is subject to a system of registration at the HM Land Registry. Land registration confers benefits and safeguards to property owners and you may take advantage of these by applying voluntarily to have your title registered.</p>

      <h3>Divorce & Separation</h3>
      <p>We know how confusing, stressful and emotionally taxing divorce can be, that’s why we are here to guide you through the process.</p>

      <p>The legal process of divorce doesn’t actually mean that financial or child arrangements are sorted and therefore these are treated as separate.

      <p>We are family law specialists with a reputation for finding solutions to problems quickly and clearly, offering you a way forward on the best possible terms. That’s the same whether you are separating, divorcing or dissolving a civil partnership.</p>

      <p>We are signed up to the Resolution Code of Practice and encourage a constructive and non-confrontational approach to resolving financial matters. We‘ll help you reach a fair agreement, usually through negotiation and mediation or, as a last resort, the court.</p>

      <h3>Child Arrangement Orders / Contact Matters</h3>
      <p>If parents cannot agree on the arrangements for the children, then one of them can apply to the court for a judge to make a decision.</p>

      <p>Although we encourage parents to try mediation or negotiation supported by solicitors before taking such a formal step, we are here to help resolve any outstanding issues.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
      
      <h3>Domestic Violence & Harassment</h3>
      <p>Domestic violence or domestic abuse is any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family members.</p>

      <p>If you are at immediate risk we act quickly to obtain a court injunction and to take steps to ensure the orders are complied with and enforced.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
      
      <h3>Care Proceedings</h3>
      <p>When social services are so concerned about a child’s welfare, they can make an application to the Court for an order. These proceedings are referred to as care proceedings.</p>

      <p>Legal aid is available to all parents in care proceedings regardless of income and we can advise and represent both parents and children (if asked to do so by the Court).</p>

      <h3>Will Writing (Single & Couple) / Codicils (Applications)</h3>
      <p>If you want to decide how your estate should be distributed after you have died you should make a Will.  Where someone dies without having made a valid Will their assets may not necessarily be distributed in the way they would have wanted or in a tax efficient manner.</p>

      <p>You cannot amend your will after it’s been signed and witnessed. The only way you can change a will is by making an official alteration called a codicil.</p>

      <p>You must sign a codicil and get it witnessed in the same way as witnessing a will.

      <h3>General/Lasting Power of Attorney/ Registration</h3>
      <p>A Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) is a document to cover potential situations in the future where you may lose, or begin to lose, your mental capacity and become incapable of dealing with your own financial affairs, or health and welfare.</p>

      <p>A Lasting Power of Attorney gives you the opportunity to select, whilst you are still able to do so, the people that you want to take care of your affairs for you.</p>

      <p>Before a Lasting Power of Attorney can be used it must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG).</p>

      <p>At P.E.Wilson & Co Solicitors, we take away the burden of completing and registering the LPA and we advise you on all aspects of the document along the way.</p>

      <p>The Grant of Representation (Probate if there is a Will or Administration if there is no Will) is the legal name for the document which will enable those responsible (Executors if there is a Will or Administrators if there is no Will) to deal with the assets and liabilities of the estate.</p>
